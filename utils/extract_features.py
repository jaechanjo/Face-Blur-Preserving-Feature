    Use the CNN to extract features from the input image x.
    
    Inputs:
    - x: A PyTorch Variable of shape (N, C, H, W) holding a minibatch of images that
      will be fed to the CNN.
    - cnn: A PyTorch model that we will use to extract features.

    - features: A list of feature for the input images x extracted using the cnn model.
      features[i] is a PyTorch Variable of shape (N, C_i, H_i, W_i); recall that features
      from different layers of the network may have different numbers of channels (C_i) and
      spatial dimensions (H_i, W_i).
